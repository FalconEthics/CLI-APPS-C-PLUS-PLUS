# CLI APPS in C++

CLI-APPS-C-PLUS-PLUS is a collection of command-line tools written in C++. The project includes tools for file management, academic calculations, and a simple game.

## Tools
- Renamer

The Renamer tool allows users to rename all files in a repository according to their preferences. Users can specify a renaming pattern and the tool will apply it to all files in the repository.

The Extension Changer tool enables users to change the file extension of multiple files at once. Users can specify the target extension and the tool will change the extension of all files in the repository that match the specified pattern.

- GPA Calculator

The GPA Calculator tool allows users to calculate their grade point average based on their grades and credit hours. Users can input their grades and the number of credit hours for each course, and the tool will calculate their overall GPA.

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple game that allows users to play against the computer. Users can choose to play as X or O, and the computer will make its moves automatically.
